**Designing my website:**

In my UX Course, I wanted to design the website with a simple design in order not to overwhelm users with too much information. In order to ensure that users had a good experience switching between mobile and desktop, I made two different mockups, one for mobile and one for desktop. 


**The content:**
 
On this site, all images found in the Portfolio section were taken by me.The logo was also done by me. The only image that wasn't mine was the background image in the homepage, it's a free image.

I got it  off this site:

**My Process:**
 
As a starting point, I made my mobile screens first. This seemed to be a much simpler approach to me. When making the mobile version, I found it very easy since all the content was usually piled in the middle because mobile screens are small. However, when I made the desktop version, I ran into numerous problems. Content would change places and move around, and some of it wouldn't display at all. To make finding my CSS issues easier, I organized all my CSS into different sections. I had a little bit of trouble when it came to having the logo in between the Ul while the logo was on the top left in the mobile screen. Another big problem I encountered was trying to center the background image on the homepage. With the help of IMDAC and W3 schools, I was able to fix it after hours of struggling.


**What I learned:**
The lesson I learned is that even if a website looks easy, do not underestimate it and be prepared to put lots of time into it. At first, I underestimated it, but I quickly realized that I had to manage my time to complete this site on time.
